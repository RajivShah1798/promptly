54,5,"## Device Determination Steps

The following steps may be helpful when trying to determine if a product is regulated by the FDA

as a medical device.

Step 1: Determine if your product meets the definition of a medical device per Section

201(h) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act.

Step 2: Determine if an appropriate product classification exists for your product

### Step 1: Determine if your product meets the definition of a medical device

The FDA considers a product to be a device, and subject to FDA regulation, if it meets the

definition of a medical device per Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.


_Per Section 201(h)(1) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a device is:_

_An instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or_

_other similar or related article including a component part or accessory which is:_


-----

_or any supplement to them,_

_(B) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure,_

_mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or_

_(C) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other_

_animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical_

_action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon_

_being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. The term_

_""device"" does not include software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o)._


To determine if your product meets the definition of a medical device, you should define the

intended use and indications for use of your product. Once you have defined the intended use

and indications for use of your product, you can determine if the product meets the definition of

a medical device.

**Intended Use** **Indications for use**


The general purpose of the device or
its function. This includes the
indications for use.


Describes the disease or condition the device will diagnose, treat,

In determining if your product is regulated as a medical device, it may also be helpful to search

for existing product classifications that may apply to your product. Finding an existing

classification that describes your product's intended use or design is a good indicator that it

might be a medical device. Three methods to determine if a product classification exists for your

product are outlined below. For further information on how to classify a medical device, please

If you identify a similar device legally marketed in the United States, you may search for an FDA

letter or order that permits market authorization. The information in the letter or order for a

similar device type might help you determine the classification of your device.

The FDA decisions that permit marketing authorization are public information and may be found

by searching the following databases, using either the Quick Search or Advanced Search

feature:

[Premarket Approval (PMA)](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/pma.cfm)

[(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/pma.cfm) – Most Class III](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/pma.cfm)

they may be legally marketed. This database includes devices with Premarket Approval,

and includes the approval order, Summary of Safety and Effectiveness, and labeling for

The FDA refers to software functions that are device functions as “device software functions.”

Device software functions may include “Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)” and “Software in

a Medical Device (SiMD).” If a software function that meets the definition of a device is deployed

on a mobile platform, it may be referred to as a “mobile medical app.” Information on mobile

[medical applications and how they are regulated is available on the Mobile Medical Applications](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/device-software-functions-including-mobile-medical-applications)

[(/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/device-software-functions-including-mobile-](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/device-software-functions-including-mobile-medical-applications)

[medical-applications) page.](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/device-software-functions-including-mobile-medical-applications)

The FDA considers software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform

these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device to be software as a medical

[device. More information is available on the Software as a Medical Device (/medical-](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/software-medical-device-samd)

      You are an expert assistant who helps to identify possible queries and their correct responses. Your primary task is to generate a list of query and responses.

      Your task is as follows -
        1) Curate a set of queries and their responses using the data present in the document chunks.
        2) The query should be made such that it has a detailed response which should be present in the document chunks.
        3) The queries should be complex answering from multiple documents chunks at a time.
        4) Generate atleast 40 queries in the output.
        5) Atleast 60% of the output queries should be complex queries.
      
      ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND:
        - Each document_chunk in <Document Chunks> will contain two field, first is document_chunk_text and second is unique document_chunk_id.
        - For each output query and response include the IDs of all the document chunk from which the response is extracted from.
        - The output should only contain the JSON and no other explaination should be part of the output.
        - The output should always be in following JSON format -
          {
            "conversations":[
            {"query": "First query", "response": "An detailed response to the first query", extracted_from_document_chunk_ids: [3, 4, 5, 6]}
            {"query": "Second query", "response": "An detailed response to the second query", extracted_from_document_chunk_ids: [10, 5, 6]}
            ]
          }
